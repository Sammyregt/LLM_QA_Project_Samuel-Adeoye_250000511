## Project Overview
 You are required to build a Question‑and‑Answering (Q&A) system that connects to a Large Language Model (LLM) API. This project also consists of two major components:
1. A Python Command-Line Interface (CLI) application
2. A simple Web GUI application for interacting with the LLM API

You will then host the Web GUI online and submit the final project folder in the required format.
